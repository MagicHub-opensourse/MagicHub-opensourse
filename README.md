MagicHub
Born For Open Source DataSets
It has always been a thorny issue for AI engineers that both the acquisition and the cleaning of high quality, clearly categorized data are time-consuming tasks. This inevitable fact may result in a considerable loss of time in algorithm optimization. Moreover, open-source datasets are usually distributed on distinct platforms and most likely different in formats. Magic Data Tech, accordingly, put time and effort into building the MagicHub community, providing developers easier access to open data. We sincerely invite all data producers and users to join us in improving this community by publishing open-source data, giving advice, or any possible way.
